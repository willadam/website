<h1> FOSS4G UK 2018 </h1>

On the 9th to 10th of March 2018, OSGeo:UK will be bringing together all those interested in free and open source geospatial software for FOSS4G UK 2018. The format and agenda is to be announced, but we're hoping to make it a great event! But...

### We Need Your Help!

FOSS4GUK 2018 is organised entirely by volunteers. We're currently in the process of formalising our organising committee. As it stands, we are looking for the following roles:

* **Head of Social Affairs** - Arguably one of the most important roles; help organise the after party on the Thursday!
* **Code Sprint Coordinator** - Help find a venue and coordinate food/drink for a codesprint on the Saturday
* **Marketing and Social Media Coordinator** - Help promote FOSS4G UK 2018!

If you are interested please speak to [James Milner](https://www.twitter.com/JamesLMilner). 

# Committee 

The current committee line up is:

* **Chair** - James Milner (3D Repo)
* **Co-Chair** - Tom Chadwin (Northumberland National Park)
* **Events Coordinator** - Isabel Ulitzsch (Geovation)
* **Treasurer** - Steven Feldman (KnowWhere Consulting)
* **Swag Coordinator** - Sam Franklin (DeepSky Consulting)
* **Sponsor Coordinator** - Max Stephan (Geovation)
* **Workshop Coordinator** - Nick Bearman (Clear Mapping)

### What

Conference format to be confirmed, but expect something similar to [FOSS4G UK 2016]() (Southampton), and/or [FOSS4G 2013, Nottingham](http://2013.foss4g.org/) only somewhat smaller.
