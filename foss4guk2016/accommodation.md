## [FOSS4G UK 2016](/foss4guk2016/) : Accommodation

**Accommodation in Southampton is very expensive, and books up quickly.**

We have a small number of rooms available at a discounted rate at the Holiday Inn Express Close to the venue (Southampton West). See [this link](http://www.hiexpress.com/redirect?path=hd&brandCode=ex&localeCode=en&regionCode=1&hotelCode=SOAUK&rateCode=IPBK6&_PMID=99502056&corpNum) for details but note they are fully booked for the night of the 15th of June so this option is no use if you are planning to stay for the hackathon.

The venue is on a bus route (the [Number 1](https://www.firstgroup.com/southampton/plan-journey/timetables/?operator=30&service=1&page=1&redirect=no)) so hotels in the centre of town are a viable option, particularly if you are joining us at our party on the Tuesday night.

Try the following:

 * [Travelodge Southampton or Southampton Central](https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/66/Southampton-hotel)
