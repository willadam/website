At [Astun](http://www.astuntechnology.com) we are passionate about geography and passionate about open (source, standards and data), and to be honest we are a bit geeky. We believe that the power of geography can enable our clients to manage assets more efficiently, inform better decisions, improve services and drive down costs. We want to help you to realise those benefits via an open and transparent business model that does not penalise clients when their demand increases or needs change, and which allows us to run a successful and sustainable business.

We believe that open source is a game changer within our industry that delivers robust, scalable technology, and market leading value through a collaborative model that matches the way we and our clients want to work.

At [SCISYS](http://gis.scisys.co.uk/) we are first and foremost software developers and we have been providing customer solutions for over 35 years. For much of this we have also been involved in geospatial services and we employ a dedicated team of mapheads. This combination means that we can tackle the whole project in an integrated way and not just address the mapping elements.
We are technology agnostic and over the years have utilised a range of geospatial tools. Currently we are excited by the power of open (both source and standards) to extend an organisation’s existing investment in spatial services and to integrate those services directly into the business process.
